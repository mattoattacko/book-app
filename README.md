# 301n11 Book App

**Author**: Matt McQuain & Ashley Breunich
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

In this application, we wanted to demonstrate our ability to do server-side templating using EJS. We implemented a basic full stack application for a list of books, which would then render books from a PostgresSQL database. However, this initial deployment of our application deals more with storing book objects in a database that our client can then make requests from, which is then rendered as a list in the client's browser. 

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

They would need to run quite a few different sets of software to build and deploy the application. These include, but are not limited to, running PSQL, Jest, npm, and liveserver. However, if the client simply wants to browse the application, they can simply go to https://ab-mm-booklist.herokuapp.com/ once it's live.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

We used multiple software applications to build this site. Primary development was done with Visual Studio Code. Repositories were set up via GitHub, and our application was deployed using Heroku. Our book database was configured using PostgreSQL. We also focused on a "mobile first" approach, ensuring proper use of SMACCS principles.
